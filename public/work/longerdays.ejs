    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        From 2010 to 2013 the LongerDays' website had undergone several transformations using a variety of premium WordPress themes. 
        None of which were specifically designed for the needs LongerDays required, nor did they properly represent the company's brand.
    </p>
    <p>             
        The company culture of LongerDays had been eccentric and vibrant, yet it was not quite represented in the same light to potiental clients.
    </p>
    <p>The goal of the new web presence would be to highlight the unique characteristics of the LongerDays service while showing the true personality through branding.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        I began with assembling the information architecture into grayscale wireframes. I decided to begin the project in code, as it could be carried through prototyping, design and finally into a custom WordPress theme.  
    </p>

    <p>
        As in most cases, the content for the project was still a work in progress, so I planned potential content areas within the wireframes using a combination of lorem impsum and potential brand messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interactive wireframes allowed us to plan and see potential user flow throughout the site.

        After the wireframe phase was completed I began applying the design and visuals directly to the already interactive prototypes. 
        The entire project was version controlled using git, therefore there was no reason not to branch the visuals on top of the wireframes.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the design and prototypes had been approved it was time to begin the development on the WordPress theme. 
        A previous weaknesses LongerDays faced with other WordPress themes is that content was difficult to remain dynamic.
        Because information was often featured several places on the website, it would often become out of date or get missed when another area would get updated.
    </p>
    <p>To solve these problems I decided to harness the WordPress custom post types and several shortcodes that could be easily maintained by management.</p>
